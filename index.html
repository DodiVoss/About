                        <h3>Programming</h3>
                        <p class="programming_skill_description">I have become infactuated with the creative and limitless possibilities programming and coding have to offer. The critical thinking provided through the field enables me to enjoy it as I am kept thoroughly engaged. I have currently completed courses on Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4 and with many more languages in hand which I cannot wait to learn. I aim to be a Junior web developer in a year's time in order to allow me to pursue my desired career and create products held within a limitless imagination. I hold an interest within UI/UX design too, to allow users to not only have something functional, but to the next step, impactful to their personal lives.</p>

                        <h3>Love for Making Food! A.K.A Cooking</h3>
                        <p class="cook_skill_description">Developing a taste for what food is brilliant or not can't only be done through eating it. In my opinion there comes a point where using your five senses of touch, sight, smell, hearing and taste towards a recipe's ingredients, becomes a profound step in enabling your artistic and culinary vision to develop beyond a horizon. I thoroughly enjoy the process which enables you to not only eat good food but to experience it too. My love for culinary works has held a passion in my heart for as long as I can remember, and has placed an impact on me, to one day be able to share my experience with the world through a cookbook. </p>
